# üõ†Ô∏è Development Practice Repository

Welcome to my practice and interview preparation repository ‚Äî a growing collection of hands-on projects, demos, and exercises using **Java 17**, **Spring Boot**, and related technologies.

This repo is structured to help reinforce my backend development skills while preparing for real-world job interviews and system design challenges.

üìà Purpose of This Repository
This repo serves two main goals:

Hands-On Practice: Reinforce concepts through real implementation.

Interview Readiness: Prepare for backend developer interviews through curated problem-solving, system design demos, and project work.

üß† Looking Ahead
This repository is continuously updated as I explore:

Distributed systems and microservices

Messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Serverless patterns using AWS

Docker & CI/CD pipelines

TDD and integration testing
